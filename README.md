## Disposable/temporary/burner email providers domains

My little collection of domains for disposable email services.

Disposable email address (DEA) is a temporary, throw-away address that expires after a short period of time. DEA provider websites offer a service where users can generate a temporary email address (with about a 10 minute lifespan, for example). Some of the most common DEA providers are 10 Minute Mail, Temp-Mail, and Fake Inbox.
